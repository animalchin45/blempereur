                    For over 20 years, I have been helping people recover from pain, anxiety, sports and work-related injuries, and the life-changing emotional assaults of childhood trauma to learn how and understand what healing really is. To become more confident, able to express their selves, live their purpose.

                    We are not only physical beings but emotional and spiritual beings, and if we don’t heal the whole self, we pay the price in the form of chronic pain, anxiety, depression, dysfunctional relationships, lifelong feelings of general malaise, and even chronic diseases.  We promote health and wellness, not disease and illness, by activating the Brain~Body~Mind Connection for healing.

                    I encourage you to look though my website to see how you can benefit from this therapy. We are not meant to heal alone.

                    Are you tired of just managing your symptoms or are you dealing with unresolved illnesses? Have you ever wondered why your symptoms resist traditional and alternative treatment approaches and just never get any resolution? Then Unified Therapy™ is for you!

                    Research shows that unreleased pain, anxiety, toxic stress, trauma, and PTSD affects not only the body and the brain, but the ability to heal pain, repetitive injuries, anxiety, and even depression.  It is one of the major foundations for illness and disease.

                    Barbara uses a Brain-Body-Mind approach called Unified Therapy™ that activates a natural, Homeostatic Stress Releasing Healing Reflex™ that addresses the etiology, rather than simply managing and treating symptoms.  It not only has the capacity to treat multiple conditions at once, but also prevents vulnerability to future occurrences. No single process, technique, or mindful practice could offer more.

            <div key={uuid()}>
                <p>
                    Unified Therapy™ is the only known toxic stress, anxiety, and pain therapy that allows active participation in the healing process and makes people conscious and aware of the things that generate pain.  While a lot of modalities/techniques just deal only with the physical or the psychological aspects to dampen symptoms, Unified Therapy™ incorporates multiple techniques based on a variety of therapies, teaching you to release all kinds of physical and emotional pain to promote systemic healing

There are also Biopsychosocial factors that affect systemic healing. All factors must be addressed and Unified for genuine healing to take place.
